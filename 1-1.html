    <h3>1. Fisrt catch your dragon</h3>
      <p>Long ago, on the wild and windy isle of Berk, <strong>a smallish Viking</strong> with a longish name <u>stood</u> up to his ankles in snow.</p>
    <br><img src="Berk.jpg" width="100%">
      <p><strong>Hiccup Horrendous Haddock the Third,</strong> the Hope and Heir to the Tribe of the Hairy Hooligans, <u>had been feeling</u> slightly <u>sick</u> ever since he woke up that morning.</p>
      <p><strong>Ten boys,</strong> including Hiccup, <u>were hoping to become</u> full members of the Tribe by passing the Dragon Initiation Programme. <strong>They</strong> <u>were standing</u> on a bleak little beach at the bleakest spot on the whole bleak island. <strong>A heavy snow</strong> <u>was falling.</u></p>
      <p>'PAY ATTENTION!' <u>screamed</u> <strong>Gobber the Blech</strong>, the soldier in charge of teaching Initiation. '<strong>This</strong> <u>will be</u> your fisrst military operation, and <strong>Hiccup</strong> <u>will be commanding</u> the team.'</p>
      <p>'Oh, not Hic-cup,' <u>groaned</u> <strong>Dogsbreath the Duhbrain and most of the other boys</strong>. '<strong>You</strong> <u>can't put</u> Hiccup in charge, sir, he's USELESS.'</p>
